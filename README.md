Hello. I'm a bioinformatician working in microbial ecology. I research on the interaction between gut microbes and their host. I try to keep my pipelines lean and share my workflows here on github mostly to train myself to portabilitize and document my work. I largely follow people on github who is into microbiology and integrative holo-omics.
