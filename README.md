Hello. I'm a bioinformatician working in clinical microbiology. I research on the interaction between gut microbes and their host. I try to keep my pipelines lean and share my workflows here on github, mostly to train myself to portabilitize and document my work. I mostly follow people on github who's into microbiology and holo- or metagenomics.
