Hello. I'm a bioinformatician working in microbial ecology. I have a focus on software engineering and holo-omics. I research the interaction between gut microbes and their hosts. I try to keep my pipelines lean and share my workflows here on github mostly to train myself to make my work portable and well documented. I largely follow people on github who are into microbiology and omic-integrative methods.

My opinion on holo-omics is that we need to do more fundamental research and basic bioinformatic tool sharpening before we can truly dive in and understand the holistic interactions in the holobiont super-organisms. That is why I am currently also focusing on developing basic stuff like annotation and pipeline tools.

ğŸš€ My current flagship project is the [Assemblycomparator2](https://github.com/cmkobel/assemblycomparator2) genomes-to-report pipeline which has just been published on bioconda.

I'm looking for a postdoctoral fellowship position from northern spring 2025. Let me know if you have a lead.
