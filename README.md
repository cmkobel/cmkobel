Hello. I'm a bioinformatician working in microbial ecology. I research the interaction between gut microbes and their hosts. I try to keep my pipelines lean and share my workflows here on github mostly to train myself to make my work portable and well documented. I largely follow people on github who are into microbiology and integrative holo-omics.
